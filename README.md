# Neighborhood Map
The Neighborhood Map app will show points of interest near a specified location. These points are plotted on a map along with a list of all points of interest. Click on any map marker or list item to show information on the selected venue.

This project is part os UdacityÂ´s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Running the app
Just download the files or clone this repo to your computer. Open file `index.html` to run the app. No installations or setups are necessary.

## Changing Neighborhoods
If you wish to change the initial location around which venues are searched, open file `app.js` and change the value of `MAP_ADDRESS` constant to any valid address.

## APIs
This app uses [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) and [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to retrieve venue photos and details.
